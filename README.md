# verticalCarousel
STILL IN DEV Carousel form that rotates to next field using css and js


The idea is pretty simple, a 3d carousel that's vertical. In the end I want it all to be js, and everything will be dynamic based on the height of the form field. There will only ever be 3 fields showing the previous, current, and next. The rest will be hidden. The math being used can be found here: https://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/docs/carousel.html The original example I used can be found here: https://codepen.io/nopr/pen/rfBJx
